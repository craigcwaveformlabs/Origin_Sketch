# Origin - Sketch Resources

Sketch template resource to accompany the Origin framework.


*See [Origin](http://fac.github.io/origin/) for the framework documentation.*


## Install

We're going to link the github repo to the local Sketch support folder on your machine.

First, navigate to your local sketch support folder, which is probably at the location below if you have a standard install.

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3
```

And then clone the Origin_Sketch repo into a new folder named 'Origin' within the Templates folder.

```
git clone git@github.com:craigcwaveformlabs/Origin_Sketch.git Templates/Origin
```

The Origin template will now be available within the Sketch app, accessed by selecting File > New From Template and navigating to the Origin file.
